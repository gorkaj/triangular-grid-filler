# Object animator

The application allows for loading .obj files, which are then mapped onto a 2D plane. The left part of the window is responsible for displaying the shape, while the right part is a panel with options.

On the panel, there are:

- a button allowing for loading .obj files
- three sliders for changing the model's lighting parameters
- a color picker for the light color
- a slider for the light position
- object color, which can be either a regular color or a loaded texture
- two algorithms for determining the fill color
- an option to use a map of normal vectors loaded from a file
- the ability to show/hide the triangle mesh
- the ability to pause/resume light animation
